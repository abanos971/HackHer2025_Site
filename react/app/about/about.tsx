              <p>We like AI as much as the next group of CS students, but we understand the risks posed by its rapid rise and ever-growing presence. This project is a proof-of-concept for a simple but potentially powerful idea if scaled up: a universal place to validate data integrity. The idea is that when you upload data, we embed a unique hash somewhere in it. Later, if you (or anyone else) need to verify that the data is still original and hasn't been tampered with, we check for that hash.
              <br />
              <br />
              Right now, it's just an experiment to show that this kind of validation can be easy and reliable. But in theory, if everyone used it, it would be the go-to place for confirming data authenticity online. For now, weâ€™re just testing the waters to show what it could be like. <span className = "text-[#A8D9EF]">The future could be far more secure than you think!</span></p>
